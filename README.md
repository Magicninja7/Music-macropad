Description: A macropad, especially created for music control. it has a pause, forward, and backward for songs, knob for volume, and 2 other customizable buttons!
Why? I am annnoyed that i have to change pages (when a horrible song plays), to go to the tab i have yt music on. It would be easier, if i had a dedicated thing to control all of that, without the need to quit my task.
